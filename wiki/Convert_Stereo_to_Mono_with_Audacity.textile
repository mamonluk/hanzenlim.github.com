Here are the steps to convert a stereo track to mono:
# Split the Stereo track.
# Make both tracks mono.
# Use the level control for each track, found on the left of the track to set to: "Gain: -6 dB". Then when you quick mix, it is guaranteed to not clip.
# Select both tracks.
# Project -> Quick Mix
