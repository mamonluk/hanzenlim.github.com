<h1>About</h1>
<p>I believe we live in interesting times.</p>
<p>I am an Australian expatriate, 10+ year IT professional specializing in VoIP and iOS development living in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy writing and by nature I think a lot.  Writing helps to clear my head.</p>
<p>What I aim to have on this site is my tech analysis, thoughts on future trends and other forms of pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
