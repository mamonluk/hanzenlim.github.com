First of all, the blogosphere seems to think that Apple needs to play "Team Apple World Police":http://www.teamamerica.com/ with Foxconn.  I think we have the New York Times to thank.  It should be noted that notable products which Foxconn manufactures include the Amazon Kindle, iPad, iPhone, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 (via "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn). 

That "zany guy":http://julianyap.com/2012/01/29/how-google-can-save-android-close-it-license-it-swim-in-the-profits.html Farhad Manjoo believes he has the "answer":http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/01/apple_foxconn_the_iphone_maker_should_ditch_its_troubling_labor_practices_and_reinvent_gadget_manufacturing_.single.html:

bq. With its vast resources, Apple could speed up this trend by investing billions in robotic factories. This, of course, raises another ethical dilemmaâ€”is it really humane to replace human workers with machines? As awful as working conditions at Foxconn might seem to Americans, the jobs are prized in China.

Unfortunately he's a crazy walking contradiction (from the same article):

bq. There are 200,000 people on the iPhone assembly line alone. The work is dull, repetitive, dangerous, and low-paying.
