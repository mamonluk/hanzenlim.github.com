bq. A source recently left the impression that the Windows Phone team has possibly been working with the folks from Instagram. Why would Instagram come to an OS with such a low market share? Mainly because it's sexy. And there's a ton of money behind it.

This is an essential move that Microsoft needs to make.  It needs to buy its way into having a viable mobile and tablet app market place for consumers.  Targeting some well picked high profile iOS apps and having them ported over to Windows Phone is the best way to go about this.
