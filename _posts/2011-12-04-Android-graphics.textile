It's a very long post.

bq. Nobody cares how it is done. It is a tad embarrassing to look at a 2011 Android phone that can't draw a list as smoothly as the 2007 iPhone. Not a single Android tablet can even come close to the responsiveness of the iPad, even with much better hardware.

bq. The closed model has and will always have huge advantages in graphics speed. Compare the performance on an Xbox with a 99% identical PC to demonstrate the difference. Coding a graphic layer which addresses a fixed hardware accelerator is simply the fastest way to achieve things so Apple will always have the advantage there.

I like the analogy.  iOS with its limited models and standardized hardware is like the Xbox/PS3 and Android is like the PC.

As a result of tightly coupled software and hardware assumptions and optimizations, iOS devices don't require as much in terms hardware.  Meaning less RAM is required to run the system, a slower CPU is adequate, a slower GPU renders everything perfectly fine, etc...

Another reason why Apple isn't in the business of touting specs because that isn't a game they are playing.
