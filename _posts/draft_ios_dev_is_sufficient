BI: We will ask you this, though. Would you be opposed to doing an app on other platforms?

PH: Well there's a couple problems there. First is a total lack of time. We're only two guys we can't do any more than we are already doing. Tweetbot as an example took ~1 year to complete and its all Objective C code. To support another platform would require rewriting everything from scratch, which is a huge task.

Second, the only two "viable" mobile platforms out there are Android and Windows Phone. I hate Java and we both don't like the way Android looks. Windows Phone's market is just too small to risk anything there at this point.

It's hard to port big apps. We also have a ton of experience with iOS/UIKit/Cocoa so there'd be a pretty big learning curve.
