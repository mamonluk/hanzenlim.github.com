In more recent years the design sensibilities of Apple coupled with their technological innovation have really appealed to me.  When the initial MacBook Air came out in 2008 it was slow and expensive.  It felt like design for design's sake and form over function and largely what I considered Apple to represent.  The 2010 MacBook Air model was a real turning point where the internal components and pricing caught up to the vision.  I believe this is where Apple stands today. 

I like how in "this video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0fe800C2CU Jonathan Ive talks about delivering a "calm and considered solution".
