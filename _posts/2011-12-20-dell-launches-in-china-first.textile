bq. Dell will choose to release more and more products for China, as its first place to launch in the world, because China is becoming an important market.

Dell can't sell their tablets and smartphones to American markets so what makes them think they can sell to China?

I'm guessing Dell is making this move because they already outsource everything to Asian countries anyway including industrial design.

bq. The Chinese search giant is in talks with other handset vendors to use the Baidu Yi mobile platform, and is considering making it available on tablets.

So this isn't even an exclusive deal.  Expect to see Dell get eaten alive by the cheaper Chinese based manufactures across all platforms that they launch first in China.
