bq. A $10 billion Facebook offering would rank fourth among U.S. companies, behind Visa Inc., General Motors Co. and AT&T Wireless. At a $100 billion valuation, Facebook would be worth about the same as McDonald's Corp. and nearly half of Google Inc.

The hotly anticipated and most likely biggest IPO for a long time moves one step closer.  The IPO filing should make for an interesting read.

Monthly active user growth has started to slow since early 2011 but it is great that Facebook's aspirations were higher and didn't give in to early acquisition bids.

In more recent times, Facebook's influence on social has been so strong that it has totally transformed a major part of Google's core search product.
