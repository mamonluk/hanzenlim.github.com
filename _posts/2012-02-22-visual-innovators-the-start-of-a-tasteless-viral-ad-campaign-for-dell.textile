The video's slow reveal approach just reeked of 'hoax' or 'viral ad campaign'.  The subtle facial language smirks.

In a quick search on the web I couldn't find anything which officially tied the campaign to Dell but the production values of the video indicate that a fair amount of funding must have gone into the project.  To me that ruled out the chance that this would have been a random creator or a competitor's smear campaign.  The marketing department at Dell hired an ad company and approved this.

A quick whois search also shows that the domain claytonsotos.com was registered on February 2nd this year.  The domain visualinnovators.com was only registered a few days ago on February 19th.  A "Tumblr account":http://claytonsotos.tumblr.com for Clayton Sotos exists with posts dating back to January this year.

I understand the concepts of a viral ad campaign but to me this comes across as tasteless.  Is Visual Innovators the first in the series of a tasteless viral ad campaign from Dell?
