Former Google UX designer intern Lo Min Ming on Google apps on Android:

bq. Google, here is the problem: If you cannot make the UI of your apps consistent, how do you expect developers to follow your design language?

I have had my work Android phone for a little over a year now and the first thing which struck me was the poor looking widgets.  It makes simple applications which do not spend a lot of time creating a customized design look poor.

Contrast this with iOS where every UI element looks fine out of the box.  This includes: buttons, text fields, sliders, date pickers, etc...
