bq. Picnik will be closing on April 19, 2012.

Already a ton of comments from unhappy users.

This reminds me of the time Google shut down Slide and with it came "outraged SuperPoke Pets players":http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/27/superpoke-pets-outrage/.

*UPDATE @ Mon Jan 23 14:12:02 HST 2012:* It looks like some people have started an "online petition":http://signon.org/sign/dont-close-picnik.fb1 which currently has 2,644 signatures.
