bq. Microsoft says it plans to run a series of newspaper adverts this week, taking advantage of concerns over Google's updated privacy policy while advertising its own alternatives. The adverts will run in major US newspapers like the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and USA Today, and will highlight the recent changes in Google's privacy policy.

I'm pretty surprised that Microsoft can create and approve such a widespread ad campaign so quickly. In either case, this is a major smack down.
