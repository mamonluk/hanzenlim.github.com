bq.. *Don't use right-pointing carets on line items*

A common pattern on other platforms is the display of right-pointing carets on line items that allow the user to drill deeper into additional content.

Android does not use such indicators on drill-down line items. Avoid them to stay consistent with the platform and in order to not have the user guess as to what the meaning of those carets may be.

p. This was kind of amusing.  That 'right-pointing caret' is a UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator by the way.  I'm pretty sure 99% of iOS users know that particular indicator "means":http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/UIElementGuidelines/UIElementGuidelines.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH13-SW1 that there will be a further screen with information associated with that row.

Instead with Android you're left guessing as to what clicking on a cell will actually do since there are no indicators.  Contrary to what they are saying.
