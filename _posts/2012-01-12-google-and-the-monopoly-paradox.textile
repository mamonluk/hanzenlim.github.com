bq. The problem with more, more, more when you’re Google is again the monopolistic aspect of your business. If you attempt to leverage your strongest asset (Search) to help along these new potential revenue streams, it goes from looking smart to looking evil. Again, it’s all about perspective.

Great article where MG Siegler addresses the antitrust issues that Google faces when it changes its core search product to drive growth in its social network Google+.

I think the article explains the issues well and he comes to some great conclusions. As a bonus he also illustrates why Apple does not face the same issues of antitrust with their business.
